## Fundamental Analysis

### Financial Statement Analysis

#### Income Statement Metrics
1. **Revenue Growth**
   - Year-over-year growth rate
   - Quarter-over-quarter trends
   - Guidance vs. actual performance
   - Healthy growth: 10-20% annually for established companies
   - High growth: 30%+ for tech/emerging sectors

2. **Profit Margins**
   - **Gross Margin**: (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
     - Software: 70-90%
     - Retail: 20-40%
     - Manufacturing: 25-35%
   - **Operating Margin**: Operating Income / Revenue
   - **Net Margin**: Net Income / Revenue
     - Compare to industry averages
     - Improving margins = operational efficiency

3. **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**
   - Diluted EPS preferred over basic
   - Track quarterly and annual trends
   - Compare to analyst estimates
   - EPS growth should match or exceed revenue growth

#### Balance Sheet Health
1. **Current Ratio**: Current Assets / Current Liabilities
   - Healthy: 1.5-3.0
   - Too high (>3): Inefficient capital use
   - Too low (<1): Liquidity risk

2. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio**
   - Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity
   - Conservative: <0.5
   - Moderate: 0.5-1.5
   - Aggressive: >1.5
   - Varies by industry (utilities typically higher)

3. **Quick Ratio**: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
   - More stringent than current ratio
   - Minimum: 1.0 for safety

#### Cash Flow Analysis
1. **Operating Cash Flow**
   - Should exceed net income
   - Consistent positive cash flow essential
   - Free Cash Flow = Operating CF - Capital Expenditures

2. **Cash Conversion Cycle**
   - Days Sales Outstanding + Days Inventory Outstanding - Days Payable Outstanding
   - Lower is better (faster cash generation)

### Valuation Metrics

#### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
- **Formula**: Stock Price / EPS
- **Interpretation**:
  - Low P/E (<15): Undervalued or slow growth
  - Medium P/E (15-25): Fair value for stable companies
  - High P/E (>25): Growth expectations or overvaluation
- **Compare to**:
  - Historical P/E of the stock
  - Industry average P/E
  - Market P/E (S&P 500 average ~15-20)

#### PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth)
- **Formula**: P/E Ratio / Annual EPS Growth Rate
- **Interpretation**:
  - <1.0: Potentially undervalued
  - ~1.0: Fairly valued
  - >1.0: Potentially overvalued
- **Best for**: Growth stocks

#### Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio
- **Formula**: Stock Price / Book Value per Share
- **Interpretation**:
  - <1.0: Trading below net asset value
  - 1-3: Typical for most companies
  - >3: Premium for intangible assets
- **Best for**: Banks, industrials, asset-heavy companies

#### Dividend Yield
- **Formula**: Annual Dividends per Share / Stock Price
- **Healthy Range**: 2-6%
- **Too High (>8%)**: Potential dividend cut risk
- **Dividend Payout Ratio**: Dividends / Net Income
  - Sustainable: 30-60%
  - Risky: >80%

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing
**Formula**: Position Size = (Account Risk %) / (Entry Price - Stop Loss) × Account Value

**Example**:
- Account: $100,000
- Risk: 2% = $2,000
- Entry Price: $100
- Stop Loss: $95

### Stop-Loss Strategies
1. **Percentage-Based**: 7-10% below purchase price
2. **Technical-Based**: Below key support level
3. **Volatility-Based**: Based on Average True Range (ATR)
4. **Trailing Stop**: Moves up with price, locks in gains

### Risk-Reward Ratio
- **Minimum**: 1:2 (risk $1 to make $2)
- **Preferred**: 1:3 or better
- **Formula**: (Target Price - Entry Price) / (Entry Price - Stop Loss)
